    <p>Interpolation, often referred to as variable interpolation or variable substitution is not something unique to Sass. Actually, you can find it in many languages (PHP, Perl, Ruby, Tcl, Groovy, Unix shells...). We often talk about interpolating a variable or interpolating an expression. To put it concisely, interpolating is the process of evaluating an expression or a string containing one or more variables, yielding a result in which the variables are replaced with their corresponding values in memory.</p>
